h1. DbAgile - SQL Databases with Agility

DbAgile aims at providing agile tools around databases, and relational/sql databases in particular.

h2. Motivation

Have you ever dreamed of having one central point for keeping your database access infos?

<pre class="shell">
  sh$ dba list
  sh$ dba use contacts
</pre> 

Or displaying a SQL table (say, 'contacts') in one shell command?

<pre class="shell">
  sh$ dba show contacts
</pre> 

Or to output the result of any SQL query to yaml, json, csv, ruby, ... or even xml?

<pre class="shell">
  sh$ dba export --yaml "SELECT name, mail FROM contacts" 
</pre> 

Or to have a Restful server on top of SQL databases?

<pre class="shell">
  dba restful
</pre>

Making similar things, ... in Ruby?

<pre>
  DbAgile::dba do |dba|
    # Override environment default values (~/.dbagile, ...)
    dba.config_file_path  = ...     # your application own config file
    dba.history_file_path = nil     # no history
    dba.output_buffer     = ...     # keep messages in any object supporting :<< (STDOUT by default)
  
    # Start using dbagile commands
    dba.export %w{--yaml contacts}  # each line pushed in output_buffer
  end
</pre>

The Rack middleware for the restful server (config.ru):

<pre>
  #!/usr/bin/env rackup --require dbagile/restful/middleware -p 8711
  app = DbAgile::Restful::Middleware.new{|env|
    #
    # Set the environment!
    #
    # WARNING: Always use ::File instead of File because constants are
    #          resolved in Rack scope, which contains a File class. Not
    #          doing this may mead to bugs in certain ruby versions.
    #
    env.config_file_path  = ::File.expand_path('../dbagile.config', __FILE__)
    env.history_file_path = nil
  }
</pre>
