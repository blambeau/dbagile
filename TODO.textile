* Implement db:backup and db:restore (through a schema)
* Handle relvar/attribute renaming in migrations
* View support in schemas (YAML refactoring required, breaks existing schemas)
* Extract hardcoded type-system and provide it as a Database feature
* Complete Restful implementation
* Implement plugins (at least Visibility and Enforce)
* Refactor on grep 'Kernel.eval'
* @pre and @post tags are used in the contracts modules but they don't appear in the yard documentation (because I don't know how to).
